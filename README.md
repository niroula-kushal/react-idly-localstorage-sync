## Concept
1. Start the timer manually so that we can control initiation of the timer.
2. Before starting the timer, check in local storage to see the last activity time.
3. If the last activity time is within the limit, start the timer immediately. Else, do the thing! Logout or something else.
4. On each activity, update the last activity time in local storage.
